Herein we: Introduce project leads and team members Summarize project themes and methods Describe study sites Provide a short demo of current methods Project summary Forest roads are an essential prerequisite for forestry, and their activation and de-activation are critical decision points for management and biodiversity conservation. Provision of single photon LiDAR (SPL) data to enhance forest management and inventory frameworks has raised pertinent questions about the potential to use these data for improving knowledge of road network coverage. The aims of this project are to: Develop and validate new automatized approaches to accurately locate forest roads across Ontario from SPL data To predict the condition (or attributes) of both active and decommissioned forest roads from SPL. The methodologies will be open-access, through the R and python scripting languages, to enable users to gain direct access to the approaches, and apply them to update, classify and attribute road layers across Ontario. Project partners This project is principally a partnership between University of British Columbia, Laval University and Nipissing University, with the Province of Ontario, RYAM Lumber and other forestry companies in Ontario. These groups of researchers have a history of successful collaboration including the use of LiDAR for forest inventories. All three universities (and researchers) were involved in the NSERC-funded AWARE project, which was a large collaborative 5-year research program between forest companies, universities and provincial and federal agencies. In addition, this project builds upon the very strong links that UBC and Laval have with the Canadian Wood Fiber Centre (CWFC), which has thus far culminated in more than 20 peer-reviewed publications on CWFC-funded work, including the award winning best practices guide. The researchers also have a long, productive relationship with Grant McCartney at RYAM Forest Management on the use and application of innovative technologies for forest inventories, particularly at the Romeo Malette forest. Resolute Forest Products staff will participate in the project through project meetings, workshops and providing guidance and editorial advice to the students and researchers within the project. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has a critical role to play in mapping roads provincially and the collaboration between the research team with the Ministry staff ensures both access to the SPL data to the researchers, but also a mechanism for the Ministry to utilize these results quickly and promote them for use throughout the Province in particular in areas where road information is poor, yet critically needed, for forest management and species at risk activities.

Project Coordinator Ilythia Morley Ilythia Morley is a recent MSc graduate in environmental science. Her research focused on the application of planetary-scale satellite data for predictive ecology and habitat suitability modelling. Ilythia will act as the project coordinator for this project to facilitate communication, data transfers, and product testing. Project Leads Prof. Nicholas Coops Professor Nicholas Coops holds a Canada Research Chair in Remote Sensing (Tier 1) at UBC. He has published &gt;460 total referenced peer-reviewed journal publications and is internationally recognised as a scientific leader in the field of remote sensing. He was the principal investigator of the AWARE project a 5-year research project focused on developing LIDAR applications in Canada for forestry applications. He is a co-author on the Canadian Forest Service LIDAR best practice guide series, the most downloaded CFS information handbook ever, focused on LIDAR data processing. In 2020, he was the co-receipt of the Marcus Wallenberg prize for scientific achievements contributing to significantly broadening knowledge and technical development within the field of Forestry. Responsibilities Coops as the PI will manage the budget, and overall assignment of students and researchers to the project. A postdoctoral fellow (PDF) will be based and supervised by Coops at UBC. They will be co-supervised by Achim at Laval whose team is already developing some approaches for road extraction. At the completion of the project the PDF at UBC will work with Achims team at Laval and ensure the software is able to be released openly and publicly to allow other forest management areas in Ontario covered by SPL data to be applied. Prof. Alexis Achim Professor Alexis Achim is the Director of Laval Universitys Renewable Materials Research Centre. He has developed expertise in the field of wood resource assessment and participated in AWARE, a Canada-wide project on using ALS to predict wood fibre resource attributes. The R package lidR, which is extensively used in the ALS international research community, was developed in his lab as part of the work done for this project. He is currently lead investigator of a new 5 year, $CAD 5million research project (Silva21) developing new silvicultural approaches and technologies for the Canadian Forest industries. Responsibilities Achim will help supervise the research undergoing at Laval relevant to roads, to ensure compatibility of approaches and that any insights are available to this project Team Members Jean-Romain Roussel Jean-Romain Roussel Prof. Jeff Dech Professor Jeff Dech is chair of the Department of Biology and Chemistry at Nipissing University. He previously held an Industrial Research Chair in Forest Bioproducts supported by Tembec, and was a co-investigator on the AWARE project. He has developed a research program focused on the use of site classification and stand structure data derived from remote sensing to describe and predict forest growth and quality over broad spatial scales. This work has focused on Ecological Land Classification and LiDAR-derived predictors and has involved the establishment of extensive networks of field plots and intensive sampling campaigns as part of several collaborative projects in the boreal and Great-Lakes St. Lawrence forests. He has extensive field experience in ecological land classification (soil and vegetation surveys), dendrochronological sampling and forest mensuration. Responsibilities Dech at Nipissing will recruit a Masters student for the field work verification of the project. This student will develop a research program to both sample existing roads and their attributes, compile GIS information to help assess road position and age, as well as develop and then implement a field program to verify road detection produced by the algorithm. This information from the Masters student will be fed back to the PDF at UBC to improve algorithm development. Dr. Douglas Reid Douglas E.B. Reid is the Boreal Silviculture Research Program Lead at the Centre for Northern Forest Ecosystem Research in Thunder Bay. His research has developed tools to evaluate the accuracy of remote sensing approaches to silviculture monitoring and is developing tools to evaluate stand height as a measure of growth performance in regenerating stands using single photon LiDAR. He has knowledge of the importance of roads and their extreme variability from conducting previous work examining caribou habitat conditions within managed and unmanaged forests in Ontario. Responsibilities Working with Reid at the Center for Northern Forest Ecosystem Research we will be able to examine the accuracy of the SPL derived road networks with existing approaches such as those from optical remote sensing. His understanding of the importance of roads attributes and age on habitat conditions will provide focus in terms of the relevance of the predicted attributes to cumulative effects mapping. In addition by having government partners on the project ensures that the outcomes will have immediate uptake by other users within the Ministry thereby ensuring successful technology transfer and knowledge exchange.

"],["projoverview.html", "Project Overview Themes Methodology", " Project Overview Themes The project is broken down into three themes. Theme 1 At the focus sites which are known to have poor road network information, either positionally or have significant amounts of unmapped roads, a new PDF will update the current road coverage layers by designing and applying a new algorithm to detect roads in the SPL point cloud and move existing road segments to their accurate position. Currently Coops and Achim have been working with Dr JR Roussel (PDF at Laval University) an expert in LIDAR data processing, on a new algorithm to detect road segments in LIDAR point clouds, which has now been developed and run with success over LiDAR coverages in Quebec. We will further develop and calibrate this new open source algorithm to the SPL point cloud data available in Ontario, and apply it at sites, using the existing road network as a base. We will move the road segments into their correct position using the algorithm, and assess the accuracy using field acquired road segment data collected by a MSc student (Nipissing) Theme 2 Develop an automated methodology to extract SPL point cloud information on, and surrounding each road segment, to build models of road condition including attributes such as width, roughness, biomass on, and adjacent to, the road, and canopy cover above the road. Theme 3 We will develop an automated methodology to improve temporal updates. Using freely available Landsat imagery from 1984  present, we will drill backwards through the SPL derived road segments, to examine changes in spectral values at road locations and assess annual presence. By assessing the date of road establishment we can provide an accumulation layer of road development (and conversely deactivation) for species such as Caribou. Methodology Road mapping We will Develop and apply an automated methodology to improve map accuracy. At focus sites which are known to have poor road network information, either positionally or have significant amounts of unmapped roads, a new PDF will update the current road coverage layers by designing a new algorithm to detect roads in the SPL point cloud and move existing road segments to their accurate position. The PDF will utilise new tools developed at Laval which have been applied with success in parts of Quebec. We will further develop and calibrate this new open source algorithm to the SPL data available in Ontario, and apply it at sites, using the existing road network as a base. We will move the road segments into their correct position and assess the accuracy using field acquired data collected by the MSc student who will review existing and develop as needed new, road condition sampling protocols to characterize road condition with respect to physical form, and surrounding vegetation and conduct field work for a sample of roads for comparison with the SPL predictions. Once the road network has been corrected, we will extend the road network coverage by applying the algorithm to find unmapped roads adjacent to the detected road network. This will ensure the algorithm is robust to false positives and while we acknowledge that is will not be possible to locate and find a full unmapped road network, it will be particularly important to avoid mapping false roads. To do so the algorithm will work with geometrical properties of the SPL point cloud taking advantage of the fact that very few natural features are analogous to a road, in geometrical terms (e.g. width, surface roughness). Road attributes We will develop an automated methodology to extract SPL point cloud information on, and surrounding each road segment, to build models of road condition attributes. We will also use citizen science tools already developed and tested at UBC which can collect information on traffic speed and road conditions automatically on a cell phone. A key focus of interest in wetter areas will be to identify locations where water crossings have been removed, or modified, associated with the road installation or de-activation, using additional stream information derived from the SPL DEM, given the importance of hydrological restoration when deactivating roads. We will use the field data to train a machine-learning algorithm to predict these attributes along each road segment to inform on the current status and management of the road network. Road timeline Using annual Landsat land cover classifications from 1984  present, we will examine changes in spectral values at road locations. Given road locations are accurately known from steps 1 and 2, any changes in spectral values such as increases or decreases in greenness will likely indicate the road was either established or potentially decommissioned around that year. By assessing the date of road establishment we can provide an accumulation layer of road development (and conversely deactivation) for cumulative effects modelling.

"],["demo.html", "Demonstration Algorithm overview Example road Detect road and calculate metrics Detecting the road Measuring the road Derive road metrics", " Demonstration Jean-Romain - in partnership with the Quebec ministry - has been developing approaches to detect, measure, and evaluate road detection from lidar data. His approach leverages the lidR package, which has seen massive uptake and use globally. lidR, also developed by Jean-Romain, is free and open source and is considered a key resource for lidar data processing globally. Algorithm overview The implementation of this algorithm is a work in progress. Function names are likely to change, methods are likely to evolve, and debug options are likely to be removed. Simply described, the current road detection and measurement algorithm measure_road() leverages the lidR processing engine to extract relevant segments of lidar data from a point-cloud with a paired linear road network. The approach is in ongoing development, but follows the following steps: A lidar dataset and road segment and provided The road segment is buffed and used to clip relevant lidar data The road is divided into incremental segments Structural lidar metrics are calculated at each segment used to define the location with the highest probability for the road Important road measurements are calculated including drivable width and embankment width. If the algorithm is confident that the road exists, a new (corrected) road segment is produced.
